read raw pcm, 24 bit



- front end: dynamic waveform views, signals and trigger indication,
    colors and graph 0 dB should be consistent across slices / trailing mean,
    not set per-slice like currently (causes banding when peak shape changes between    bins)
- websocket: kick periodic wave segment dumps into stream

- wav: read n channels "at once"


- tests: wav, gen, ws



- read-and-slice-and-fft-stereo-wav:
--- keep increasing :end-offset to apply-edge-offsets but large
      neg spike area is just as long but fewer and fewer data samples
      in the center (??)
