read raw pcm, 24 bit


- front end: dynamic waveform views, signals and trigger indication,
    colors and graph 0 dB should be consistent across slices / trailing mean,
    not set per-slice like currently (causes banding when peak shape changes between    bins)

- wav: read n channels "at once"


- tests: wav, gen, ws, filters

- filterbank as structured array of generated fmcw rx wavelets
