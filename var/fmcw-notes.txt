range fft, fast time: each sweep's samples from each rx channel
-- complex results saved and stuffed into a vector of some length for
doppler fft, slow time: fft of the range fft, tells how phase changes across sweeps (velocity)
spacial or angle fft: across range fft values by rx antenna- range bin by bin (can it be all at once in 2d)
-- for each rangefft bin, gives the freq and phase diff at antennas of that bins power
---- complex results are: range fft bin power at angles split by bin



for a pixel on normal radar graph:
- distance r from origin: brightness varies with that range fft bin's magnitude
- angle theta left or right of center:
---- brightnes at each row/ring varies with spacial fft of that distance's range fft
       across rxs's bin magnitude



general cl-radar TODOs as of 2025-01-06:
- finish making wavegen generators emit list of trigger edges in the returned buf
- new top level loop thing to read live data, take the trigger edges and slice,
   ship out to websocket
- 2d fft- range doppler with beamstacking (phase rotation strategy vs subsample interpolation delay)
- 3d fft with slow time doppler fft and fft across antennas
- music, samv, etc
